# 📊 Event Pricing Analysis Using Excel (Scenario Manager & What-If Tool)

This project demonstrates how Excel's **What-If Analysis** and **Scenario Manager** can be used to model and compare the costs of various college events organized by a student organization.

By simulating multiple cost scenarios (e.g., changes in food, equipment, and resource pricing), the project provides actionable insights to support **budgeting**, **event planning**, and **decision-making**.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Objective**: To determine the estimated cost for different types of college-organized events by evaluating changing expense components using Excel’s Scenario Manager.
- **Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel, What-If Analysis, Scenario Manager, Conditional Formatting
- **Output**: A clean, interactive Excel model with dynamic pricing scenarios for Food Fest, Technical Fest, and other event types.

## 🧩 Key Features

✔️ Built using Excel’s **Scenario Manager** to test multiple pricing outcomes  
✔️ Evaluates **cost sensitivity** by adjusting variables such as:
  - Food cost
  - Equipment rental
  - Guest speakers/performers
  - Logistics and miscellaneous expenses  
✔️ Compares up to 3 scenarios side-by-side  
✔️ Easy-to-read summary dashboard for presenting total estimated costs  
✔️ Supports informed decision-making and financial planning

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Data Entry**: Input cost estimates in editable cells for various components.
2. **Scenario Setup**: Use Excel’s Scenario Manager to define different cost scenarios (e.g., best case, worst case, standard case).
3. **Compare Outputs**: View the summary output table and compare the total costs for each scenario.
4. **Adjust Variables**: Change individual inputs like food or travel costs to observe impact on total event cost.
